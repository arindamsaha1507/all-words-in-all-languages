# How to contribute?
1. Create a file for your language [here](https://github.com/eymenefealtun/all-words-in-all-languages/tree/main/how_to_use).
   
2. Add `1- Import the txt file into your project.` as a comment line. (If there are any necessary changes to be made to your language, please make them.)

3. Provide all the necessary information step by step in the comment line to ensure that the .txt file works without any issues.

4. In the last comment line, add `<numberOfLastStep>- Assign to a string array using method below;`

5. Create a method called `GetLanguageArray` that returns an array of strings from the target .txt file. (This method reads the target .txt file, splits it into an array, and returns the array.)

6. Provide information in the comment lines for the method as needed.
